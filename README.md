"Counter" on React TypeScript.
__________________________________
Setting the maximum and minimum values for the counter.
 When the button is pressed, the number on the display
 increases by 1 each time until the maximum is reached.
 When the maximum value is reached, the number turns red,
 and the counter zoom button is blocked.
Only the reset button remains active.
